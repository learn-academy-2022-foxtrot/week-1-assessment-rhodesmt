# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is an open-source software sorter that allow multiple different types of files to be utilized. GitHub is a domain that acts as a cloud networks for git files to allow remote access for multiple users to a single "drive", or branch.

Researched answer: Git is an open-sourced version control program that allows for the sharing and editing of the same code base to multiple developers. It is normally accessed through the command line. Github is a website that provides hosting and git version control that allows for integration and collaboration, version control through a graphical user interface rather than a command line.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: ==, ===, &&, !&&, true, false, will all return a Boolean value in the terminal.

Researched answer: Relational operators like greater than >, less than <, greater than or equal to >=, less than or equal to <=. Loose == and Strict === equality operators, the logical operators like and &&, or ||, and not !. These will all return a Boolean value for the called upon line of code. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the location within an Array or String that is currently being occupied by a value. A value is the piece of information contained within the given index at the time. Indexes begin at 0 and count up for each index contained within the array or string.

Researched answer: A value can be a string, boolean, number, or any other type of JavaScript data type. An index is the numbered place within a given array beginning at 0 and counting up.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: A string is contained within quotation marks " " and are used to store a single combined set of values. An array is contained within brackets [ ] and can be used to store many sets of a certain type of data that can be useful for the developer to identify as part of a larger set. 

Researched answer: String are a collection of character wrapped in quotation marks. The string can store as many characters as needed, but are all contained within the string. An array allows us to store ordered data, that enables us to manipulate, rearrainge, modify, and identify specific information within the data sets of the given array.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming will involve two distinct roles: (1) The Driver is responsible for actually writing down the code that is being dictated to them by (2) the Navigator. The driver is resonsible for sharing their screen to allow the Navigator to be able in real-time to direct them in the programming process. This forces those in the Navigator role to talk out their logic and thought processess out loud, as well as explain to those who may not have as good a grasp of the concept for the given assignment.

Researched answer: The Driver is responsible for using the mouse and keyboard while sharing their screen. The are following the instructions of the Navigator for what to type in the code editor. The Navigator is responsible for monitoring the code being type, advising the Driver with any questions or assistance that may require deviating from the code to check a reference source for specific information. This also allows for the Navigator to assist with bugs, typos, or errors that might otherwise go unnoticed. Through this constant flow of communication, the "neural load" is shared between the programmers allowing them to code better together.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that brings in a function as an argument. They are only called on arrays, are able to utilize less code than a typical function, and as a result utilize less CPU. .map() amd .filter()

2. Jest: A JavaScript testing framework that allows developers to run tests using a collection of files with bits of code functionality. Facebook in 2016 created Yarn which acts as a package manager for the dependencies location within the Jest framework.

3. Objects: A collection of key:value pairs stored in curly braces, with the key being a data type of symbol and the value being any valid data type within JavaScript

4. Method: An action that can be performed on an object. Specific to the object in its performance. Essentially, a variable is being created with a function the output specific data in the new variable when called on.

5. Classes: A particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the structure for objects, and must consist of a specific syntax and keywords to utilize within JavaScript.
